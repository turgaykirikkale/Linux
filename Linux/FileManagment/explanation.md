### File and Directory Management
1. **`ls`** – Lists files and directories in the current location.
2. **`cd /path/to/directory`** – Changes the working directory.
3. **`pwd`** – Prints the current working directory.
4. **`mkdir new_folder`** – Creates a new directory.
5. **`rmdir empty_folder`** – Removes an empty directory.
6. **`rm file.txt`** – Deletes a file.
7. **`rm -r folder`** – Deletes a folder and its contents.
8. **`cp file1.txt file2.txt`** – Copies a file.
9. **`cp -r dir1 dir2`** – Copies a directory recursively.
10. **`mv old_name new_name`** – Moves or renames a file or directory.
11. **`touch <file_name>`** - it creates new file in the directory

### File Viewing and Editing
11. **`cat file.txt`** – Displays file content.
12. **`tac file.txt`** – Displays file content in reverse order.
13. **`less file.txt`** – Opens a file for viewing with scrolling support.
14. **`more file.txt`** – Similar to `less`, but only moves forward.
15. **`head -n 10 file.txt`** – Displays the first 10 lines of a file.

17. **`nano file.txt`** – Opens a simple text editor.
18. **`vi file.txt`** – Opens a powerful text editor.
