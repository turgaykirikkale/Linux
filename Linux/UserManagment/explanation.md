# User Management in Linux

## Introduction to User Management in Linux
Linux is a multi-user operating system, meaning multiple users can operate on a system simultaneously. Proper user management ensures security, controlled access, and system integrity. 

Key files involved in user management:
- `/etc/passwd` – Stores user account details.
- `/etc/shadow` – Stores encrypted user passwords.
- `/etc/group` – Stores group information.
- `/etc/gshadow` – Stores secure group details.

## Creating Users in Linux
To create a new user in Linux, use:

### `useradd` Command (For most Linux distributions)
```bash
useradd username
```
This creates a user without a home directory.

To create a user with a home directory:
```bash
useradd -m username
```

To specify a shell:
```bash
useradd -s /bin/bash username
```

### `adduser` Command (For Debian-based systems)
```bash
adduser username
```
This is an interactive command that asks for a password and additional details.

## Managing User Passwords
To set or change a user’s password:
```bash
passwd username
```

### Enforcing Password Policies
- **Password expiration**: Set password expiry days
  ```bash
  chage -M 90 username
  ```
- **Lock a user account**
  ```bash
  passwd -l username
  ```
- **Unlock a user account**
  ```bash
  passwd -u username
  ```

## Modifying Users
Modify an existing user with `usermod`:
- Change the username:
  ```bash
  usermod -l new_username old_username
  ```
- Change the home directory:
  ```bash
  usermod -d /new/home/directory -m username
  ```
- Change the default shell:
  ```bash
  usermod -s /bin/zsh username
  ```

## Deleting Users
To remove a user but keep their home directory:
```bash
userdel username
```
To remove a user and their home directory:
```bash
userdel -r username
```

## Working with Groups
### Creating Groups
```bash
groupadd groupname
cat /etc/group ==> check if group was created 
```

### Adding Users to Groups
```bash
usermod -aG groupname username
```

### Viewing Group Memberships
```bash
groups username
```

### Changing Primary Group
```bash
usermod -g new_primary_group username
```

## Sudo Access and Privilege Escalation
### Adding a User to Sudo Group
On Debian-based systems:
```bash
usermod -aG sudo username
usermood -aG Dev J ==> user J added group Dev
cat /etc/group  ==> you can check here if added or not
```
On RHEL-based systems:
```bash
usermod -aG wheel username
```

### Granting Specific Commands with Sudo
Edit the sudoers file:
```bash
visudo
```
Then add:
```bash
username ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /path/to/command
```


when you buy first time your computer you need to create admin user and password for the admin user you dont create other user because its your application 

whereas when you talk about Linux Server and you will work with team can you imagine if the all users use same root account , when all of ou users uses same root account its not safety for this reason we create users and groups 
there is no password restore old password when you forget ıf you can reach out liux server still you can not restore 


why we need groups you have 500 users on Linux server 250 Developers 200 QE 30 are devops engineers 10 managers for example you need to change one permission for developers and you need to do this for 250 developer, but when you create a group and then when you change group permissions all group will have this permission
