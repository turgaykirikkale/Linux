  because schells are backward compatible they dont change they stay same for example if you write a schell scripting 3 years ago it will probably work even today

  1. you need to give name truly like if you do VPC something for AWS ==> aws_vpc_creation.sh
  2. Provide description begin of the file.(more context)
  3. variables you can use
  4. if you dont understand you can ask AI dont worry
